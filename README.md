###  Phonology

The Phonology Tab allows users to define and manage the phonetic inventory of their language. This is where you'll define the sounds that make up your language and the rules governing their combination.

#### Sections

1. **Monitor Pane**: This side pane contains buttons for various phonological features such as Phonemes, Syllable Structure, Stress, Feature Geometry, Tone, and Intonation. Clicking on a feature button will display its editor in the central Editor Pane.

2. **Editor Pane**: Displays the editor corresponding to the selected feature from the Monitor Pane. For instance, when "Phonemes" is selected, you can add, edit, or remove phonemes.

3. **Inspector Pane**: Displays detailed information about a selected item from the Editor Pane. For phonemes, it will show details like its symbol, type, IPA representation, and description.

#### Using the Phonology Tab

1. **Adding Phonemes**:
    - Type the phoneme symbol into the input box located at the bottom of the Editor Pane.
    - Click the "+" button or press Enter to add the phoneme.
    - Newly added phonemes appear as buttons in the grid above.

2. **Editing Phonemes**:
    - Click on a phoneme button to select it.
    - The Inspector Pane will populate with the phoneme's details.
    - Edit the details directly in the Inspector Pane and click "Save Changes" to update the phoneme.

3. **Deleting Phonemes**:
    - Select a phoneme by clicking its button.
    - Click the "-" button at the bottom of the Editor Pane to remove the selected phoneme.

#### Tips

- Ensure that phonemes are unique. The application checks for duplicates and will not allow you to add a phoneme that's already present in the inventory.
- The application supports batch addition of phonemes. Separate multiple phonemes with commas or spaces in the input box.
